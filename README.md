# R-workshops

this is a home for my various attempts at teaching R! my teaching style is very self-guided exploration, rather than having explicit tasks laid out, so the scripts often reflect the adventure we took that day following people's curiousities. lmk if you have any questions or want the data sets that go with the exercises!
